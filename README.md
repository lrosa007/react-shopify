# rx obv

**Influences**: [mxstbr](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate) and [tbash](https://github.com/tbash/react-starter)

So whats the difference? Well no much, I just removed [redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga)
and added [redux-observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable)

> bc rx logo is like super dope. Jay Phelps is not joking when he says get a good logo first.

**Featured Tools**:

* [react](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [react-scripts](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (This keeps the package.json nice and short. Also handles webpack configs + much more)
* [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
* [redux-devtools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) (browser extension)
* [redux-observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable)
* [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)
* [immutable](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/)
* [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs)

Of course there's the couple extra libs that glue it all together:
[react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux), [react-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux), and [redux-immutable](https://github.com/gajus/redux-immutable)

## Example App
I figured it was appropriate to do the classicly epic ping example, but that might change.

## TODO

* maybe some generators?? :/
* more intricate example for learning
