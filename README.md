# react/redux/redux-observable shopify

**Influences**: [mxstbr](https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate) and [tbash](https://github.com/tbash/react-starter)

I built a store with shopify using a bunch of react based tooling.

## TODO
* Explain it all
* Accidentally placed some containers in components
  folder and vice verse (my bad)
* Add some features
  * Cart Modal (wasn't allowed to come along)
  * Cart Action (same reason^)
  * Don't forget to check localStorage for cartId
  * Other Stuff tba
* Better styles
* List libraries involved (not so many actually)
* Maybe some architecture charts (idk??)
* Set up some photos in the shopify backend
* Deploy sample
